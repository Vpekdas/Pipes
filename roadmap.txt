4. Redirecting Standard Input/Output:
   - Duplicate File Descriptors:
     - Use dup2() to duplicate file descriptors for standard input/output redirection.

5. Implementing a Simple Command Execution:
   - Parsing User Input:
     - Parse user input to identify commands and arguments.
   - Executing Commands:
     - Use execvp() or similar functions to execute commands in child processes.

6. Handling Multiple Commands and Pipes:
   - Parsing Pipelines:
     - Extend your parser to handle multiple commands separated by pipes (|).
     - Create pipes and processes accordingly.

7. Error Handling and Cleanup:
   - Check Return Values:
     - Always check the return values of system calls for errors.
   - Cleanup Resources:
     - Properly close file descriptors and release any allocated resources.

8. Testing and Debugging:
   - Create Test Cases:
     - Develop test cases to ensure your program works correctly.
   - Debugging:
     - Use debugging tools like gdb if needed.

9. Optional Enhancements:
   - Redirection Handling:
     - Implement support for input/output redirection (<, >, >>).
   - Error Handling Improvements:
     - Enhance error messages and handling.

10. Documentation:
   - Document Your Code:
     - Add comments and documentation to make your code understandable.

11. Learn and Iterate:
   - Explore Further:
     - Explore more advanced features like signals, background processes, etc., depending on your interests.
     - Consider extending your program based on your learning goals.

Resources:
   - Refer to C programming and Unix system programming books for more in-depth knowledge.
   - Online tutorials and forums can be valuable for troubleshooting and expanding your understanding.
